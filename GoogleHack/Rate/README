GoogleHack version 0.01
=======================
This is the Rate.pm module. This module allows the user some basic Natural 
Language processing capabilities. It interacts with the GoogleHack::Search 
module.


Provides basic Natural Language Processing features, by using the results 
retrieved from Google.

* Find the Pointwise Mututal Information measure of two words

Given two words, the moduleinteracts with Google, and retrieves the number of
 times the given words occured. The PMI is calculated as follows:

Given, phrase1 and phrase2:

PMI (phrase1, phrase2) = log( (Number of times phrase1 & phrase2 co-occured) / 
(Number of times phrase1 occured) (Number of times phrase2 occured) )

For example, the PMI measure for the search phrases "knife" and "cut" would be greater than for "knife" and "write".

* Given a paragraph find if the paragraph has a positive or negative 
orientation

The user provides the module with a paragraph of text, for example, a review 
of an automobile. The module will then issue multiple queries to Google, and 
calculates the relatedness between the different combination of words in the 
review. If the total of the PMI measure results are positive then the review has a positive semantic orientation, and if the total is negative then the reviewe has a negative semantic orientation.

* Given a search string and a proximity value, can retrieve a top n number of sentences with the search string surrounded by a certain number of words (proximity).

* Find the top n words occuring with the search string within a certain proximity given.



INSTALLATION

There are multiple ways to install the modules. 


1) You can use CPAN.pm to install GoogleHack. To install the module type the
 following
:

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install GoogleHack'


2) Otherwise, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The advantage of Using CPAN to install the module is that it will also install 
all the other modules required by GoogleHack.

DEMONSTRATION
-------------


use GoogleHack;

$search = new GoogleHack;
$search->init( "key","GoogleSearch.wsdl");
$correction=$search->phraseSpelling("dulut");
$results=$search->Search("duluth");

print $search->{'searchTime'};
print $search->{'snippet'}->[0];;

$results=$search->measureSemanticRelatedness("knife","cut");

$search->initConfig("config.txt");
$search->printConfig();

$search->predictSemanticOrientation("ggapi/googleapi/review.txt",
"excellent","bad");


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
POD style documentation is included in all modules and scripts
You can look @ `perldoc GoogleHack` for more information about the specifics 
of each module. The description of each method in the modules is also given.
