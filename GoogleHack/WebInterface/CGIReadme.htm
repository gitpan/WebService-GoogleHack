<h1><a name="webservice::googlehack_web_installation_guide">WebService::Google-Hack Web Installation Guide</a></h1>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p>The WebService::Google-Hack web interface provides an easy to use interface
for some of the features of WebService::Google-Hack.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>To install the interface please follow these steps:</p>
<p>The web interface for WebService::Google-Hack has been implemented such that, there needs to be a WebService::Google-Hack Server running in the background, so that the client file google_hack.cgi can connect to the server on a specific port, and retrieve results.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="installation_guide">Installation Guide</a></h1>
<p>1) Create a directory named ghack in your cgi-bin directory (Where all your cgi files reside). So it should be something like:</p>
<p>/webspace/cgi-bin/ghack</p>
<p>2) Next, copy the file named google_hack.cgi, which is given with the 
distribution of the google-hack package into your cgi-bin/ghack/ directory.</p>
<p>3) Open the google_hack.cgi file, and change the lib path to the path where 
WebService::GoogleHack has been installed on your machine.</p>
<p>use lib ``/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/'';</p>
<p>*Note:
The google_hack.cgi file is in the WebInterface directory of GoogleHack.
For eg: WebService/GoogleHack/WebInterface.</p>
<p>4) Now, open the ghack_server.pl file (which is also given in the  WebInterface directory of GoogleHack), and change the lib path to the path where WebService::GoogleHack has been installed on your machine.
</p>
<pre>

use lib &quot;/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/&quot;;</pre>
<p>5) In the ghack_server.pl file, change the following variables accordingly:</p>
<p>$BASEDIR = '/webspace/cgi-bin/ghack';</p>
<p>$localport = 32983;</p>
<p>$lock_file = ``$BASEDIR/ghack_server.lock'';</p>
<p>$error_log = ``$BASEDIR/error.log'';</p>
<p>Basedir should be the path to the cgi-bin directory in which google_hack.cgi 
resides.</p>
<p>The localport should be a number above 1024, and less than around 66,000. Make
 sure that localport number is the same on both the client and server side.</p>
<p>The lockfile &amp; error_log variables will remain the same.</p>
<p>6) Now, open the google_hack.cgi  file (which is also given in the  WebInterface directory of GoogleHack),</p>
<p>Set the remotr_host, and remote_port variables to the correct values.</p>
<p>$remote_host = '';</p>
<p>$remote_port = '';</p>
<p>The remote host will be the IP address of the machine where the google_hack server will be running.
The remote port needs to be the same as the $localport variable in ghack_server.pl</p>
<p>7)If your ghack server is running behind a firewall, you will need to
edit the file /etc/sysconfig/iptables to allow clients to connect to the machine through the port you had given.  There is a line that looks like this:</p>
<p>-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport XXXXX -j ACCEPT</p>
<p>Where XXXXX is the port that your client will be connecting to (the value of $localport in ghack_server.pl).</p>
<p>Now start the server by running the ghack_server.pl as you would run a 
regular perl file.
</p>
<pre>

You should now be able to use the web interface.</pre>
