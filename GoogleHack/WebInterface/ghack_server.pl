=head1 GoogleHack web interface server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ghack_server.pl acts as a server to which the web interface connects to for all user queries.
The server then retrieves the results of the queries and sends it back to the web interface.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To install the server please follow these steps:

1) Change the following variables accordingly:

The localport should be a number above 1024, and less than around 66,000. Make
 sure that localport number is the same on both the client and server side.

$LOCALPORT = XXXXX;

The path to the GoogleHack/Temp directory eg, /home/username/WebService/GoogleHack/Temp/

$ghackDir="";

This would be the Google-Hack configuration file eg /home/username/WebService/GoogleHack/Datafiles/initconfig.txt

$configFile="";


2)If your ghack server is running behind a firewall, you will need to
edit the file /etc/sysconfig/iptables to allow clients to connect to the machine through the port you had given.  There is a line that looks like this:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp --dport XXXXX -j ACCEPT

Where XXXXX is the port that your client will be connecting to (the value of $localport in ghack_server.pl).

Now start the server by running the ghack_server.pl as you would run a 
regular perl file.
