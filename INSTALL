WebService::GoogleHack Version 0.06

WebService::GoogleHack Installation Guide

INSTALLATION
-------------

If you would like more information on installing Perl modules, visit:

   http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html


Please make sure to install the entire package.

There are multiple ways to install the module. 


1) You can use CPAN.pm to install WebSerivce::GoogleHack. To install the module type the following commands in the Unix command prompt:

   COMMAND: perl -MCPAN -e 'install WebSerice::GoogleHack'

The advantage of Using CPAN to install the module is that it will also install 
all the other modules required by WebSerivce::GoogleHack.

2) Otherwise, to install the module manually:

   2.1) Unzip and untar the GoogleHack installation files.

   COMMAND: gunzip WebService-GoogleHack-0.06.tar.gz

   COMMAND: tar -xvf WebService-GoogleHack-0.06

   2.2) Next, CD into the untarred GoogleHack directory.

   COMMAND: cd WebService/GoogleHack/

   2.3) Next, make the installation:

   For the command given below, please make sure to replace LOCALPERLLIBPATH 
   and  LOCALBINPATH with the path to your local perl lib directory and 
   your local bin directory respectively. We do not need to create these 
   directories manually, because the installation command later on will 
   automatically take care of that. An example command is also given.

   COMMAND: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=LOCALPERLLIBPATH LIB=LOCALBINPATH

   EXAMPLE COMMAND: perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/username/lib/ LIB=/home/username/bin

   2.4) Next, type in the following command:

   COMMAND: make
   
   2.5) Next, We need to test if the package is working correctly:
   
   *Note: This command will also prompt the user for the Google API key, and 
    the path to the Google wsdl file.
    
   COMMAND: make test

   2.6) If the tests were succesful, install the program:

   COMMAND: make install

   If the tests were not successful, you must be missing some of the 
   pre-requisites or you must have typed in the wrong API key or path to 
   WSDL file.


3) Next, we need to add this LOCALBINPATH to the perl @INC variable. To do 
   this, open your .cshrc file, this should be in your local directory.

   /home/username/.cshrc

   3.1) Open your .cshrc file and add this line to it:

   3.1)setenv PERL5LIB LOCALBINPATH

   Where you would replace LOCALBINPATH with the your local directory name.

   EG: setenv PERL5LIB /home/username/bin 

   Save the changes, Next issue the command:
   
   COMMAND: source .cshrc

   *Note:If you get an error saying command "setenv" not found, replace the 
   word sentenv with the word "export" and try sourcing the .cshrc file again.

   This should have added the LOCALBINPATH to your Perl @INC variable.To see if
   the command was successful, issue the following command:

   COMMAND:perl -V

   This command will print out all the directories in which Perl would look for
    modules.

4) To install the web interface please follow the instructions given in
